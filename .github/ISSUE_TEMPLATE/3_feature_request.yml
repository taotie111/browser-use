      label: "What is the problem that your feature request solves?"
      description: |
        Describe the problem or need that your feature request solves, include screenshots and example URLs if relevant.

        e.g. I need to be able to simulate dragging in a circle to test the paint feature on a drawing site: https://example.com/draw

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed_solution
    attributes:
      label: "What is your proposed solution?"
      description: |
        Describe the ideal specific solution you'd want, *and whether it fits into any broader scope of changes*.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I want to add a default controller action that can hover/drag the mouse on a path when given a series 
        of x,y coordinates. More broadly it may be useful add a computer-use x,y-coordinate style automation 
        fallback method that can do complex mouse interaction tasks.

      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: workarounds_tried

      description: |
        A description of any troubleshooting, alternative approaches, workarounds, or other ideas you've considered to fix the problem.
      placeholder: |
        e.g. I tried upgrading to the latest version and telling it to hover in the prompt. I also tried 
        telling the agent to ask for human help (using a custom controller action) when it gets to this 
        step, then I manually click a browser extension in the navbar that automates the mouse movevement.

      label: What version of browser-use are you currently using?
      description: |
        Run `pip show browser-use` or `git log -n 1` and share the exact number of git hash. DO NOT JUST ENTER "the latest release" OR "main".
        We need to know what version of the browser-use library you're currently running in order to contextualize your feature request.  
        Sometimes we've already added your feature in a newer version, sometimes features already exist but may not be available in your specific environment.
