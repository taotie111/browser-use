## Overview

[As of Chrome v136](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/issues/1520), driving chrome via CDP is [no longer supported with the default profile](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port).  
Browser-Use has transitioned to creating a new dedicated profile for agents in: `~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default`.  
You can [open this profile](https://superuser.com/questions/377186/how-do-i-start-chrome-using-a-specified-user-profile) and log into everything you need your agent to have access to, and it will persist over time.

## Connection Methods

### Method A: Launch a New Local Browser (Default)

Launch a local browser using builtin default (playwright chromium) or a provided `executable_path`:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# If no executable_path provided, uses Playwright/Patchright's built-in Chromium
browser_session = BrowserSession(
    # Path to a specific Chromium-based executable (optional)
    executable_path='/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome',  # macOS
    # For Windows: 'C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe'
    # For Linux: '/usr/bin/google-chrome'
    
    # Use a specific data directory on disk (optional)
    user_data_dir='~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default',
    # ... any other BrowserProfile or playwright launch_persistnet_context config...
    # headless=False,
)

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```

### Method B: Connect Using Existing Playwright Objects

Pass existing Playwright `Page`, `BrowserContext`, and/or `Browser` objects to `Agent(...)` and/or `BrowserSession(...)`:

```python
from browser_use import Agent
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
# or from patchright.async_api import async_patchright

async with async_playwright() as playwright:
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
    context = await browser.new_context()
    page = await context.new_page()
    
    browser_session = BrowserSession(
        page=page,  # or browser_context=context, or browser=browser, or playwright=playwright
    )

    # Can pass any of: page, browser_context, browser, playwright
    agent = Agent(
        task="Your task here",
        llm=llm,
        page=page,
        # or browser_session=browser_session, or browser_context=context, or browser=browser
    )
```

### Method C: Connect to Local Browser Using Browser PID

Connect to a browser with open `--remote-debugging-port`:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# First, start Chrome with remote debugging:
# /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9242

# Then connect using the process ID
browser_session = BrowserSession(browser_pid=12345)  # Replace with actual Chrome PID

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```

### Method D: Connect to remote Playwright Node.js Browser Server via WSS URL

Connect to Playwright Node.js server providers:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# Connect to a playwright server
browser_session = BrowserSession(wss_url="wss://your-playwright-server.com/ws")

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```

### Method E: Connect to Remote Browser via CDP URL

Connect to any remote Chromium-based browser:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, BrowserSession

# Connect to Chrome via CDP
browser_session = BrowserSession(cdp_url="http://localhost:9222")

agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=llm,
    browser_session=browser_session,
)
```



## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  When using any browser profile, the agent will have access to:
  - All its logged-in sessions and cookies
  - Saved passwords (if autofill is enabled)
  - Browser history and bookmarks
  - Extensions and their data
  
  Always review the task you're giving to the agent and ensure it aligns with your security requirements!
  Use `Agent(sensitive_data={'https://auth.example.com': {x_key: value}})` for any secrets, and restrict the browser with `BrowserSession(allowed_domains=['https://*.example.com'])`.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Use isolated profiles**: Create separate Chrome profiles for different agents to limit scope of risk:
   ```python
   profile = BrowserProfile(
       user_data_dir='~/.config/browseruse/profiles/default',
       # profile_directory='Default'
   )
   ```

2. **Limit domain access**: Restrict which sites the agent can visit:
   ```python
   browser_session = BrowserSession(
       allowed_domains=['example.com', 'http*://*.github.com'],
       # ... other settings
   )
   ```

3. **Enable keep_alive for multiple tasks**: Keep the browser open between agent runs:
   ```python
   browser_session = BrowserSession(
       keep_alive=True,
       # ... other settings
   )
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome Won't Connect

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. **Close all Chrome instances** before trying to launch with a custom profile
2. **Check if Chrome is running with debugging port**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep chrome | grep remote-debugging-port
   ```
3. **Verify the executable path** is correct for your system
4. **Check profile permissions** - ensure your user has read/write access

### Profile Lock Issues

If you get a "profile is already in use" error:

1. Close all Chrome instances
2. The profile will automatically be unlocked when BrowserSession starts
3. Alternatively, manually delete the `SingletonLock` file in the profile directory
